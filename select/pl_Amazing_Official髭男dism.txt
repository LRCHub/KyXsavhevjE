Amazing grace how sweet the sound
that saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
was blind but now I see

and grace my fears relieved
how precious did that grace appear
the hour I first believed
Amazing grace how sweet the sound
that saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
was blind but now I see
